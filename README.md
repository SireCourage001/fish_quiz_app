This is an ALX cum Holberton School Portfolio, born out of a need to aid learners of Fisheries to learn with ease and fun, and to prepare them for O'level examination.
A teacher cum SoftWare Engineer in the making? Yes, I am. This project was incited by the excitement I’d have when my students who enjoyed my teachings of Fisheries now see that they can play some games online with the subject of their interest. The Fish_Quiz_App as named is geared towards making learners of the subject ace their O’level examination while playing and learning.
I cherish it when learners learn with ease and making it fun is more or less a grandeur hobby of mine. In Nigeria, students who offer Fisheries as a trade subject write both WAEC and NECO examinations respectively. Helping them pass with flying colours is what birthed this idea.
It takes more than grit to switch from an Agricultural Education background to Software Engineering. No excuses permitted? Yes. WHY? Because in ALX, we do hard things. Thus, the hard things done led to developing this web-based application that is borne out of a sincere heart of meeting the needs of learners.
This app is developed using JavaScript, HTML and CSS, which can be accessed using the web and mobile.
